# adventure-game

This is my attempt at an offline, single-player text-based adventure game, intended to perform similarly to a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon). Initial commit includes framework for time-based combat (not turn-based), area creation, inventory system, character sheet, NPC generation, and commands for movement/exploration.

Ideas I'd like to implement include:
  'help' command to list all current functions and their usage
  'get' command to pick up items in an area
  'use' command to use items in inventory
  color code keywords
  expand game world
  add a story
  add special abilities/magic
  multiprocesing/threading for input during combat sequence (so player can heal/use special abilities in place of a basic attack)
  2v1 fights
